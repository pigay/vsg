      Quaternions are special 4D vectors. Unit quaternions can be used to
      represent 3D rotations. Many of these functions have an inlined
      counterpart that one can reach in the "vsgquaternion@t@-inline.h" or
      "vsg@t@-inline.h" header file. Inlining of vsg_quaternion@t@_* functions
      will be automatically done when including this header unless you define
      VSG_NO_IMPLICIT_INLINE before the corresponding include directive.
      In such case, one can always use the inline functions by appending
      "_inline" to the desired function name.
