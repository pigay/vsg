    Many of these functions have an inlined counterpart that one can reach in the "vsgvector3@t@-inline.h" or "vsg@t@-inline.h" header file. Inlining of vsg_vector3@t@_* functions will be automatically done when including this header unless you define VSG_NO_IMPLICIT_INLINE before the corresponding include directive. In such case, one can always use the inline functions by appending "_inline" to the desired function name.
